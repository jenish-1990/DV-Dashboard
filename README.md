## Diabetes Visualization

We have made a dashboard which gives a brief description about the people suffering with Diabetes Globally.
We have presented the data in age groups 0-19 and 20-79.
We have also estimated the number of diabetic patients might increase or decrease in the future on the basis of past data in different regions or country's of the world.

## Appendix

Here we have shown types of Diabetes
(1)Type-1-diabetes
